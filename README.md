# musical-interval-spellings-driller
A script that drills you on musical interval spellings. Using this program, you can learn interval spellings extremely quickly as you can do hundreds of repetitions in just a couple of minutes. I created this to use personally, without having plans to publish it online, and it was exactly what I needed.

Note that it doesn't cover any music theory, it just drills you on the spellings and makes it really easy for you to learn them and memorize them.


To use:
Type down one interval you want to be drilled on.
This is case sensitive. Lowercase "m" stands for "minor", uppercase "M" stands for "major".
Options are:
P1 - Unison
m2 - Minor second
M2 - Major second
m3 - Minor third
M3 - Major third
P4 - Perfect fourth
A4 - Augmented fourth
D5 - Diminished fifth
P5 - Perfect fifth
m6 - Minor sixth
M6 - Major sixth
m7 - Minor seventh
M7 - Major seventh
P8 - Perfect octave
